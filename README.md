# Testing-Procedural-Map-Generation-In-Unity

This project has two way to generate procedural map and it is created for testing only. Some error may occur during testing (If it has a huge map, it can't draw mesh. etc.).

Noise algorithm can draw mesh and texture including color of the map.
Diamond-square algorithm has texture only(black and white).
